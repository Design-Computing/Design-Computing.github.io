# BVN specific setup instructions

Hi! If you're here, it's because you're setting up a BVN managed Surface laptop. It's actually simpler than the general instructions because there's no _if this thing goes wrong, do this_, so let's get started:

## Things to download and install:

you'll need to download and install these three bits of software:

1. **VS Code** This is your _editor_. It's where you'll do almost everything.

    Go to [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and click the download button. (_Download for windows, stable build_). Run it and install it. 
    
    Follow the prompts and accept all the default settings.

1. **Git** This is your _version control manager_. It's an incredibly powerful way to work with other people and to manage your progress.

   Go to [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) and download the latest release (on the teal screen, right now that's 2.36.0, but get whatever is the newest.) 
   
   Install it, but on the page that asks about what "default editor" to use, choose _visual studio code_. Then on the page after that, choose "override" and leave the option as `main`. Go with all the other defaults.

1. **Python** This is the actual programming _language_.

    Go to [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and get the version that it reccomends (in the yellow button, right now that's 3.10.4, but get whatever is the newest.)

    This is the only installation that you might get stuck on. There are two kinds of installation, _just for you_ and _for everyone_. You don't have enough permissions to do a _for everyone_ instalation.
