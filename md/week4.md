## Lab

1. There are some running examples in `IOexamples.py`, read them, step through them, and you should have a pretty good idea of what to do in `exercise1.py`. You should be feeling pretty comfortable with how this process works by now.

1. Talk to a tutor about your open data project idea. Get started on the data audit process described below.

Here's the example from the lecture if you want to try it out:

```python

import requests
import json

url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1"

r = requests.get(url)
if r.status_code is 200:
    the_json = json.loads(r.text)
    print(the_json)
    print(json.dumps(the_json, indent=4))
```

## Homework

   Don't watch all of this, but flick through it. Almost everything demoed here is new in this demo.
