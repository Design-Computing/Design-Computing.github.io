There's a file to go with this video. I explain how to get it in the first few minutes of the video.

Here's a quick example of some analysis in real life:

This is on my own [Walden Pond](http://waldenpond.press/) project, so if you want to know more about it, ask away.

## Lab

1. Data project
   1. Talk to a tutor about your open data project idea.
   1. Load your data into a notebook. If you don't have tabular data (a .csv or an .xlsx talk to Ben or Scarlett)
   1. Get started on the data audit process described [here](https://design-computing.github.io/md/week3#data-audit).
1. Exercises
   1. Talk to Ben or Scarlett about anything that you'd like clarity on about any of the exercises we've done so far.

## Homework

Finish the data audit on the dataset that you have decided to go with. Make sure that you've run that dataset past Ben or Scarlett to check that it's OK.

Finish all the exercises that have been set so far (so up to the end of the binary search). Go back over the previous exercises and see if you can make them better. I've seen a lot of code that's not doing anything.

# This week's optional reading üìö

Although this reading is optional, it'll make a you a way better CoDe person! Maybe re-read the early readings, they might make more sense now.

# This week's homework

1. Finish this week's exercises

1. Redo as many of the exercises as you feel you need to until you feel fluent with them.

1. Take a look at these. Watch this one:

   You might want to find out more about Alan Kay, he's an interesting character in his own right.

   Don't watch all of this, but flick through it. Almost everything demoed here is new in this demo.
